This post looks at building an interactive tool, using python, to find out the end locations of crosses 
based on user input (cross start location). The user input gets the cross start location. Using that, 
the crosses nearby the start location are identified and their corresponding end locations are plotted on the graph. 
This uses a simple concept called cKDTree, which uses nearest-neighbor lookup concept.
